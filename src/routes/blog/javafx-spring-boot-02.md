In the article, I will present how to setup a JavaFX project with Spring Boot. This will be a super simple application only to demonstrate the initial setup.

## Creating an empty Spring Boot project

Since we'll be using Spring Boot, it makes sense to use [spring initialzr](https://start.spring.io/) and create and empty project. Settings should look like this:

![spring initialz configuration](/images/blog/javafx-spring-boot-starter-02-01.png)

Note that the only dependency is Lombok which is optional. Now let's take a look at the project structure.

![spring boot project structure](/images/blog/javafx-spring-boot-starter-02-02.png)

As you can see nothing is special here. We only have one class as the main entry point of the application and that's it. Let's rename auto generated the class name from `JavafxSpringBootStarterApplication` to `SpringBootApp`.

```java
@SpringBootApplication
public class SpringBootApp {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		SpringApplication.run(SpringBootApp.class, args);
	}
}
```

At this point, we haven't even added JavaFx as a dependency to our project.


## Setting up the initial JavaFX Hello World app

Let's start by adding JavaFX as a maven dependency first.

```xml
  <properties>
		<java.version>17</java.version>
		<javafx.version>17.0.1</javafx.version>
	</properties>

  ...

  <dependency>
    <groupId>org.openjfx</groupId>
    <artifactId>javafx-controls</artifactId>
    <version>${javafx.version}</version>
  </dependency>
```

Now we can write our super simple JavaFx hello world application class.

```java
public class JavaFxApp extends Application {
    @Override
    public void start(Stage primaryStage) throws Exception {
        Pane helloPane = new Pane(new Label("Hello JavaFx"));
        primaryStage.setScene(new Scene(helloPane, 200, 100));
        primaryStage.show();
    }
}
```

And we launch `JavaFxApp` from `SpringBootApp` as follows. Note that we replaced `SpringApplication.run` with JavaFX's `Application` class as `Application.launch`.

```java
@SpringBootApplication
public class SpringBootApp {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Application.launch(JavaFxApp.class, args);
    }
}
```

In theory, we could merge move `@SpringBootApplication` and the `main` method into the `JavaFxApp` class and could get rid of `SpringBootApp` entirely. However, this wouldn't work for [a reason related to Java Modules](http://mail.openjdk.java.net/pipermail/openjfx-dev/2018-June/021977.html). In a nutshell, if our application is a non-modular application, we have to separate application classes this way. Otherwise, we see the following error message:

```text
Error: JavaFX runtime components are missing, and are required to run this application
```


Let's not forget to let Spring know that this is not a web application by adding the following to `application.properties`.

```properties
spring.main.web-application-type=none
```

Now if we run our `SpringBootApp` we should see something like this:

## Conclusion

We have hooked up Spring with JavaFx but to able to making the full advantage of Spring, we need a little bit more wiring and I will explain that in the next article.
