<h1>Harun Zafer</h1>

<p>Hi and Welcome!</p>

<h3>Professional</h3>

<p>
	I am a Software Engineer who loves working on problems that can be solved with Natural Language
	Processing and/or Machine Learning. I like understanding proven methods and applying them to real
	world problems more than doing cutting edge research and writing papers.
</p>

<p>
	I have a technical <a href="http://hrzafer">blog</a> in Turkish which also serves as my personal page
	in my native tongue. However, I can’t find time/motivation to post new articles anymore.
</p>

<h3>Personal</h3>

<p>
	My full name is Harun Resit Zafer. Resit is my middle name and was my grandfather’s first name.
</p>

<p>I am Turkish and a Canadian citizen who lives in Toronto.</p>
