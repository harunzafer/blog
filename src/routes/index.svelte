	<h1>Hi, I'm Harun.</h1>

	<p>I am a software engineer, an open source contributer, and a blog writer.</p>

	<h3>Professional</h3>

	<p>
		I am a Software Engineer who loves working on problems that can be solved with Natural Language
		Processing and/or Machine Learning. I like understanding proven methods and applying them to
		real world problems more than doing cutting edge research and writing papers.
	</p>

	<p>
		I have a technical blog in Turkish which also serves as my personal page in my native tongue.
		However, I can't find time/motivation to post new articles anymore.
	</p>

	<h3>Personal</h3>

	<p>
		My full name is Harun Resit Zafer. Resit is my middle name and was my grandfather's first name.
	</p>

	<p>I am a Turkish Canadian who lives in Toronto</p>

	<p>Malatya, the land of apricots is my hometown.</p>
